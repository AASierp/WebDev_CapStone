### Summary:

---

Task Forge is a lightweight KanBan Board web application for task organization and tracking. Designed in the vein of popular project management tools such a Jira and Trello. the frontend was built using the React.js w/Vite, the backend was constructed using Node.js and Express.js and includes a SQlite database for persistence.

### Installation and Operation

---

To run this application locally, you can clone the project to a directory of your choosing.
In your terminal, navigate to said directory and run the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/AASierp/WebDev_CapStone.git
```

from here open the directory in Visual Studio or your preferred development environment.
in the terminal once more, change directory(cd) into taskforge/client and run:

```
npm install
```

this will install all necessary dependencies as outlined in the package.js

Once complete, perform the same operation but this time in the taskforge/server directory.

### Future Improvements

---

Eventually, I hope to create am expanded version, that will be a kind of "life management" application. While pondering this expansion, I thought the name "LifeForge" would probably be more appropriate in the future. So naturally, I googled it to see if it already existed. While it is not a production application, I did discover another github project repo with the exact name and concept. While this is highly dissappointing, I will likely continue anyway if only for the experience and the ability to customize it entirely to my own needs and desires.
